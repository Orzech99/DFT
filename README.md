# DFT

Discrete Fourier Transform is a program that takes "shape data" as ordered x and y coordinates of points that make the shape and changes it to a system of epicycles
created based on Discrete Fourier Transform that works together to recreate the shape.
DFT is also able to re-draw what the user has drawn in an app (see the last video, I know I can't draw, but my program can!).
